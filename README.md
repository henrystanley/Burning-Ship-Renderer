Burning Ship Fractal Renderer
=============================

This is a smallish program written in processing which renders parts of the Burning Ship Fractal. The code is slow, poorly organized, and just plain bad, but I thought somebody might have a use for it, so here it is. Configuration is done by tweaking the constant values in the 'Parameters' section. I have to say though, while the program is pretty rubbish, the images it produces are rather nice. [Here](http://kdt.io/post/11) are some examples for those that are skeptical.
